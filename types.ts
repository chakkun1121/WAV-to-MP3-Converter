// This enum is defined in hooks/useWavToMp3Converter.ts and re-exported or used there.
// For global types, this file can be used.
// Since ConversionStatus is tightly coupled with the hook, it's defined there.
// If other global types were needed, they would go here.

// Example of a global type (not directly used by this app structure but for demonstration):
// export interface UserProfile {
//   id: string;
//   name: string;
// }

// Keeping this file minimal as per current app structure.
// The main enum ConversionStatus is in useWavToMp3Converter.ts for better modularity with the hook.
// If we need app-wide types independent of specific hooks/components, they'd go here.
// For now, it's mostly a placeholder for future expansion.
export {}; // Ensures this file is treated as a module.
